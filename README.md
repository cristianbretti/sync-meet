# Sync-Meet - Calender meeting project

Sync-Meet is a meeting scheduler that utilizes Google calendar. By synchronizing several users calendars, Sync-Meet finds a timespan where every or the majority of users can attend a meeting. The flow of the program is as follows:

1. A user goes to the homepage of sync-meet and accepts access to its personal calendar.  

2. The user inputs the following:
* Group name: The name of the group for the meeting
* Name: The name that this user will have in the group
* Start date: The start date from where the calendar should find a meeting. 
* End date: The end date to where the calendar should find a meeting. 
* Start time: The earliest time of day the meeting could be from. 
* End time: The latest possible time of day a meeting can end. 
* Meeting time: How long the meeting should be in hours and minutes.
